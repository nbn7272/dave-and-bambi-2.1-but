Furiosity is missing due to me losing it, sorry
Blocked has missing samples I can't find so you'll have to deal with those
For Bambi's vocals just open Slicex and add break_phone.ogg from the Dave files
Bambi's samples for Splitathon are included in the Samples folder, simply open Fruity Slicer (not slicex) and drag them in
Bambi Finale (Cheating)'s audio files "markdm" and "marcello for 9 mins" won't be uploaded for now until found.

Plugins required to load these songs properly:
sforzando w/ this soundfont: https://gamebanana.com/tools/7009
DirectWave w/ NyxTheShield BF Soundfont (dwb version)
EZdrummer 2 (Used in Insanity and Splitathon, uses a whole gigabyte of memory so make sure your pc can handle that)
Drumkit soundfont (Used in Corntheft for fills)
Serum (Used in Corntheft for those heavy leads you hear)
reFX Nexus (Used in Corntheft for basses and pads)

Samples for songs will be included
